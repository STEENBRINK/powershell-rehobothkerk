Some scripts for changing the youtube title, downloading videos etc. in Powershell for my local church

making use of the youtube api, specifically the liveBroadcasts part by editing the snippet.

Which uses ffmpeg: https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg


For the stream we use Bitfocus Companion: https://github.com/bitfocus/companion
